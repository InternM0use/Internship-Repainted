# Internship-Sandwich-Fest.
Internship! A fan game made by Kvas_Salty Rebooted by Me!

Welcome to Internship!
Internship was a Pizza Tower-inspired fangame developed mostly by salty_kvas, with music by The Inverted Iceberg and Voice Acting by derpguy125.

The 2022 demo was privated due to negative reception, there has also been various playtest builds made for select playtesters and developer builds for developers only. There was also a official Discord server for the game, which has been deleted in April 2023 due to salty_kvas quietly ending work on the game.

As of June 6, 2023, the itch.io page for the 2022 Demo was relisted along with the text "THIS IS AN OUTDATED BUILD. WAIT FOR UPDATES," quite possibly signaling an inevitable 2023 Demo. Please do not harass kvas for it. It comes when it's ready.
